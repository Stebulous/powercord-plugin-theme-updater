# powercord-plugin-theme-updater
Python script to quickly update all of your [Powercord](https://powercord.dev) plugins & themes.

This is a fork of [bluebewwy's updater script](https://github.com/bluebewwy/powercord-plugin-theme-updater)

My version was made in and for Windows, if something here does not work on your system, it should be fairly easy to edit.
